{"englishParagraphs":["A day after China’s ruling Communist Party announced a broad rollback of the “zero Covid” restrictions that had smothered the economy and transformed life in the country, the propaganda apparatus on Thursday began the daunting task of promoting an audacious revision of history.","While the rest of the world concluded months ago that the coronavirus was becoming less deadly, Beijing presented the development as fresh news to explain its abrupt decision to undo the lockdowns that prompted widespread protests. In doing so, it also made a high-risk bet that vaccination rates in China are sufficient, or soon will be, to prevent a severe outbreak that overwhelms the nation’s hospitals.","“The pathogenicity of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus now is significantly reduced,” Wang Guiqiang, a health expert, told reporters in Beijing at a news briefing on Thursday that was widely covered in state media. “Everyone should treat it with a normal heart — there is no need to be nervous or even fearful.”","State television also trumpeted assertions that more than 90 percent of cases of the year-old Omicron variant are mild or asymptomatic, without explaining the sudden embrace of such conclusions. The health commission released details on how residents should quarantine at home if they test positive, instead of at hospitals. Workers began tearing down testing booths. Officials detailed new limits on when and how local authorities can impose lockdowns.","There were scenes of both relief and confusion over the easing of the lockdowns. Rush-hour traffic returned to Beijing’s long empty roads. People posted selfies marking their return to work and to dining at restaurants. But any celebratory mood seemed dampened by worries about getting sick, with people rushing to order home Covid test kits and fever medications.","Even China’s leader, Xi Jinping, seemed to distance himself from the unwinding of his signature policy, traveling to the Gulf for several regional summits — one of the few overseas trips he has taken during the pandemic. Mr. Xi’s travels were highlighted on the front page of the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, where there was no mention of “zero Covid” or its overhaul.","For months, state media commentaries and experts had played up the threat of Omicron to justify his strict policy of lockdowns, mass quarantines and testing that had disrupted daily life.","“They knew the severity of Omicron, but they did not want to tell people the truth. Instead they started to exaggerate the severity of the disease, the virulence, in order to justify the policy of ‘zero Covid,’” said Yanzhong Huang, a global health specialist and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.","“Suddenly, you have all these experts coming out to justify why this policy relaxation is necessary,” he said, referring to health officials whose messages around the pandemic have pivoted drastically in recent days.","China’s jarring, whiplash-inducing narrative shift around Omicron points to the challenge for the party as it tries to prevent this week’s sudden abandoning of “zero Covid” from being construed as an admission of failure and a stain on Mr. Xi’s legacy. For years, China has pushed a triumphalist narrative about its top-down, heavy-handed approach to eradicating infections, saying that only the Communist Party, under Mr. Xi’s leadership, had the will and ability to save lives.","The changes the government announced on Wednesday — which would limit lockdowns and scrap mass mandatory quarantines and hospitalization for most cases — amounted to a reversal of “zero Covid” in the face of public opposition and mounting economic costs. But the party is deploying the full force of its propaganda and censorship apparatus to depict the transition as part of the plan all along.","More crucially, state media appeared to be distancing the policy shift from Mr. Xi, in stark contrast to the summer of 2020 when they had highlighted Mr. Xi’s declaration of victory against Covid when the restrictions curbed infections. Even the term “zero Covid” has suddenly disappeared from official statements and officials’ remarks.","Opening China up to a highly transmissible outbreak is not the success that Beijing had hoped to achieve, said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago. “They realized that this is not something that is worth celebrating,” he said. “Reopening has taken too long, and praising Xi may very well be counterproductive.”","Cases have surged, with the country reporting an average of around 30,000 cases a day in the last week, though with the cutting back of testing, such tallies are expected to soon result in an undercount. International experts have warned that China’s strategy of relying heavily on snap lockdowns and contact tracing, at the expense of ramping up vaccinations, has put the country at risk of overwhelming the chronically underfunded and understaffed public health care system. Compared with many other Asian countries, China has fewer intensive care beds per capita.","Images and videos posted on Chinese social media and state media showed the rapid dismantling of the some of the most widely feared or despised features of the “zero Covid” controls around the country. Workers carted away signs denoting mass testing sites and ripped down posters that restricted subway use to those who had negative Covid tests. Prefabricated makeshift hospitals, which Beijing had once touted as proof of its ability to mobilize but had quickly become symbols of the state’s power to detain citizens, were torn down.","Internet censors seemed to be trying to tread a delicate line. Xiao Qiang, an expert on censorship at the University of California, Berkeley, said that since the new policy was announced on Wednesday, censors have tried to erase posts and comments that either called for sticking to the stringent “zero Covid” measures or supported the complete removal of restrictions.","“The government has indeed turned 180 degrees, but it does not allow the public to call it a complete failure of the previous policy,” Mr. Xiao said. “It also wants to basically control the narrative that what the government did was right, and the new policy shift is not directly the result of the protests.”","For the party, the strategy of playing down the threat of the virus is a gamble because it can be difficult to predict how China will fare as the virus continues to spread unabated. But health officials are worried about a surge in cases overwhelming the country’s hospitals, especially after mandating for nearly three years that anyone who tests positive must be admitted.","In a speech reported by the China Youth Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, on Wednesday, a former infectious diseases official predicted that as much as 90 percent of the population could eventually be infected with Covid. Feng Zijian, the former deputy head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said officials must quickly accelerate vaccinations, especially in older people, and prepare the health care system for an influx of patients.","Spreading the message that most cases will not require any medical treatment could help hospitals with triage. On Thursday, China’s national health commission issued a plan that enabled Chinese to use store-bought rapid-antigen tests instead of relying on the widely criticized government-run P.C.R. tests. Residents who tested positive with self-administered tests could choose to quarantine at home, the plan said.","Many ordinary Chinese appeared to be bracing themselves for a widespread outbreak. On Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform, people shared tips for quarantining at home. Residents began to stockpile drugs and pain killers, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen, apparently driving up prices in stores.","At the same time, many Chinese were quick to point out the party’s abrupt turnabout in policy. On Weibo, users mocked experts who had been enlisted to justify the central leadership decisions. Foremost among them was Liang Wannian, the chief scientist working with the World Health Organization on studies into the origins of the pandemic. (For months, Mr. Liang talked up the deadliness of the Omicron variant, but told reporters on Wednesday that the virus “has now become milder.”)","“The people persisted in popularizing science to the experts,” wrote one widely circulating post on social media. “The experts finally realized that Covid is less serious than the flu.”","Hazel Liu, a resident in Beijing who had taken part in a recent protest, saw the easing as evidence that the public pressure campaign had worked. She was glad to see malls in the city lift rules requiring customers to show negative tests before entry. “I hope I can travel abroad in 2023!” she added.","In many ways, the new policy was also a vindication of health experts and others who had previously been silenced, or ignored, for questioning China’s zero-tolerance approach.","When Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, described China’s “zero Covid” policy as unsustainable in May, his comments were censored on the Chinese internet and denounced as “irresponsible” by a foreign ministry spokesman.","Chinese social media users shared articles recalling Zhang Wenhong, a epidemiologist in Shanghai and an earlier proponent of easing. Shortly after Shanghai entered a brutal 60-day lockdown in April, Mr. Zhang and other authors published a study on the weakening lethality of the Omicron variant that was widely criticized.","On Thursday, an article titled: “Mistaken criticisms of Zhang Wenhong and ‘living with the virus’ cost us a year,” was shared widely. The article was later removed.","Many Chinese returned to Dr. Li Wenliang, the first victim of censorship involving the pandemic, who died in early 2020 after contracting the coronavirus. Users flocked to Dr. Li’s Weibo page to leave heartfelt notes of solidarity. “Dr. Li, it’s finally over.” one user wrote. “We miss you. Thank you for your hard work.”"],"chineseParagraphs":["周四，在执政的中共宣布广泛取消扼杀经济、改变国民日常生活的“新冠清零”限制的第二天，中国的宣传机器开始了一项艰巨任务，那就是推动对历史的大胆修正。","虽然全世界其他地区在很久之前就已得出新冠病毒致死率正在下降的结论，但北京将这一事态发展当作全新信号，以此解释为何突然取消引发了广泛抗议的封锁措施。此举也意味当局下了一个高风险赌注，即中国的疫苗接种率能达到——或是很快能达到——防止导致全国医院不堪重负水平的严重暴发。","“目前新冠病毒奥密克戎毒株的致病力明显下降，”卫生专家王贵强周四在北京的新闻发布会上对记者表示，官方媒体对此进行了广泛报道。“大家还是以平常心对待它，不必要紧张甚至恐惧。”","国家电视台还大胆断言，对于已经传播一年之久的奥密克戎变异株，九成以上病例都是轻症或无症状感染者，却没有解释突然支持此类结论的理由。卫健委公开宣传居民在测出阳性后应如何在家隔离而不是去医院。工人开始拆除核酸检测点。官员们详细解释了地方政府何时以及如何实施封锁的新规定。","对于封锁的放松，民众在如释重负的同时也感到困惑。北京空旷已久的马路上，高峰时段又出现了车水马龙的景象。人们纷纷晒出复工和去餐馆吃饭的自拍照。但对生病的担忧似乎浇灭了庆祝的心情，民众纷纷抢购新冠快速检测试剂盒和退烧药。","就连中国领导人习近平似乎也与其标志性政策的松动保持了距离，前往海湾地区参加多场地区峰会，而这是他在疫情期间为数不多的海外访问活动。中共喉舌《人民日报》的头版重点报道了习近平的出访，对“新冠清零”及该政策的全面调整只字不提。","数月以来，官媒评论和专家声音一直在渲染奥密克戎的威胁，以证明习近平扰乱日常生活的严厉封锁、大规模隔离和检测政策的合理性。","“他们知道奥密克戎的严重程度，但不愿告诉民众真相。相反，他们开始夸大这种疾病的严重性和病毒的致病力，只为证明清零政策的合理性，”全球卫生问题专家、美国外交关系委员会高级研究员黄严忠表示。","“突然之间，所有这些专家又站出来说明为何放松这一政策是必要的，”他说道，指的是卫生官员最近在疫情相关信息上的急剧转向。","中国关于奥密克戎突如其来的急刹车式叙事转变，说明了中共所面临的挑战，即防止本周突然放弃“新冠清零”的举措被解读为认输，并给习近平的政治遗产留下污点。几年来，中国一直在宣扬采取自上而下的高压手段根除感染的必胜论，称只有习近平领导下的共产党才有意愿和能力拯救生命。","面对公众的反抗和不断加剧的经济代价，政府在周三宣布的调整——限制封控范围并基本取消大规模强制隔离和收治——相当于对“新冠清零”的逆转。但中共正在动用政治宣传和审查机器的全部力量，将这种转变描述为运筹帷幄的规划。","更为关键的在于，官媒似乎将政策转变与习近平拉开了距离，这与2020年夏天的情况形成鲜明对比，当时封控遏制了感染，官媒都在强调习近平宣布抗击新冠疫情的胜利。现在，连“新冠清零”的说法都突然从官方公告和官员发言中消失。","芝加哥大学教授杨大利表示，与高传染性的疫情短兵相接并非北京想要看到的成功。“他们明白这并不值得庆祝，”他说。“重新开放拖得太久，再赞美习近平可能适得其反。”","中国感染数已出现激增，上周平均每天报告约3万例。但随着检测减少，统计数字将很快出现降低。国际专家警告，中国严重依赖快速封锁和密接追踪，未能加快疫苗接种，可能导致长期资金和人力不足的公共医疗系统不堪重负。相较于亚洲许多国家，中国人均重症监护床位较少。","中国社交媒体和官方媒体上发布的图片和视频显示，全国各地“清零”管控措施中一些最令人恐惧或最让人厌恶的手段被迅速解除。工作人员运走了代表大规模检测点的标志物，撕毁了限制新冠检测阴性者乘坐地铁的海报。预制构件的方舱医院被拆除。北京曾将方舱吹捧为其动员能力的证明，但很快就成为了国家扣押公民权力的象征。","互联网审查机构似乎在小心翼翼地走钢丝。加州大学伯克利分校研究审查问题的专家萧强表示，自周三宣布新政策以来，审查人员一直试图删除那些呼吁坚持严格“清零”措施或支持完全取消限制的帖子和评论。","“实际上已经转向转了180度了，可是它不允许社会的舆论说这是前边的彻底失败，”萧强说。“它还要把它基本上控制在一个前边也是政府做的对，然后现在再出现的新的情况并不直接acknowledge（承认是）这个抗议（的结果）。”","对中共来说，淡化病毒威胁的策略是一场赌博，因为随着病毒继续有增无减，可能很难预测中国接下来的情况。但卫生官员担心病例的激增会让该国的医院不堪重负，特别是近三年来，所有检测阳性的人都必须入院。","在《中国青年报》周三报道的一篇讲话中，一名前疾控官员预测，多达90%的人口可能最终会感染新冠病毒。前中国疾病预防控制中心副主任冯子健说，官员们必须迅速加快疫苗接种，特别是老年人的疫苗接种，并使医疗系统为大量患者的涌入做好准备。","宣传“大多数病例不需要任何治疗”的信息，可以帮助减轻医院的负担。周四，中国国家卫生健康委员会发布了一份通知，允许中国人使用药店购买的快速抗原检测，而不是依赖由政府管理、广受批评的核酸检测。该计划称，自我检测呈阳性的居民可以选择居家隔离。","许多普通中国人似乎正在为大规模暴发做准备。在中国流行的社交媒体平台微博上，人们分享了在家隔离的种种技巧。居民们开始囤积药物和止痛药，包括布洛芬和对乙酰氨基酚，这似乎推高了药店的售价。","与此同时，许多中国人立刻指出了中共政策的突然转变。在微博上，用户嘲笑那些被请来为中央领导决策辩护的专家。其中最重要的是与世界卫生组织合作研究大流行起源的首席科学家梁万年。(几个月来，梁一直在鼓吹奥密克戎变种的致命性，但周三他对记者说，“目前的病毒更加温和了”。)","“老百姓坚持不懈地，对专家进行科普，”社交媒体上一个广泛流传的帖子写道。“专家终于明白，新冠比流感还轻。”","参加最近一次抗议活动的北京居民黑兹尔·刘（音）认为，这种放松是公众压力运动奏效的证据。她很高兴看到该市的商场取消了要求顾客在入场前出示核酸阴性检测结果的规定。“2023年我想出国旅游！”她还说。","在很多方面，新政策也证明了卫生专家和其他一些人的正确性，他们此前因质疑中国的“清零”态度而被迫保持沉默或遭到忽视。","今年5月，当世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞(Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus)称中国的“清零”政策不可持续时，他的言论在中国互联网上遭到审查，并被外交部发言人谴责为“不负责任”。","中国社交媒体用户分享了一些文章，回忆起上海流行病学家张文宏，他是放松政策的早期支持者。今年4月，在上海进入为期60天的残酷封锁后不久，张文宏和其他作者发表了一项关于奥密克戎变异株致命性减弱的研究，受到了广泛批评。","周四，一篇名为《错误批评张文宏和共存论，让我们失去了一年》的文章被广泛转发。这篇文章后来被删除。","许多中国人再次想到了李文亮，他是此次疫情审查的第一个受害者，并在感染新冠病毒后于2020年初去世。微博用户涌到李医生的主页，留下真诚的声援留言。“李医生，结束了。”一名用户写道。“想念您，谢谢你，辛苦了。”"]}
